### Non-release versions

Each push *(to any branch)* triggers a new build on [AppVeyor](https://appveyor.com/).

Non-release builds [can be viewed here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ChristianSpecht/scm-backup/history).  
You can [download the latest build here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ChristianSpecht/scm-backup/build/artifacts).

Note that AppVeyor deletes artifacts older than six months *(as stated in their [Artifacts retention policy](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/packaging-artifacts/#artifacts-retention-policy))*, so all non-release builds will be kept for six months only.
