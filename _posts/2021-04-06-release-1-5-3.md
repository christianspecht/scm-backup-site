[SCM Backup 1.5.3](https://github.com/christianspecht/scm-backup/releases/tag/1.5.3) is available to download.

Changes:

- Logging improved under the hood.  
  Loggers can now:  
    - backup their configuration files 
    - execute code when SCM Backup exits (which simplifies the code for the [Emailing output](https://docs.scm-backup.org/en/latest/output-email/) feature)
