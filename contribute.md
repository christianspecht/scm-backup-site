Contributions are welcome!

- Please don't send anything via mail, [fork the repo](https://github.com/christianspecht/scm-backup/fork) and [create a pull request](https://github.com/christianspecht/scm-backup/pulls) instead

- Generally: [Here's a list of issues which could use some help](https://github.com/christianspecht/scm-backup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

- The most common "type" of contribution will probably be adding support for a new source code hoster:
	- [Documentation how to do this](https://docs.scm-backup.org/en/latest/contribute-app.html)
	- [List of requested new hosters](https://github.com/christianspecht/scm-backup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+hoster%22)
